      "A CNC waterjet cutting machine is an industrial tool that uses a high-pressure stream of water to cut through metal, plastic, and other materials. This process can be done with or without abrasive material in the stream depending on the type of material and project design. The abrasive material, which is added to the stream during cutting operations, makes it possible for these machines to work faster than ever before while still maintaining a high degree of accuracy.",

      "5-axis machining provides infinite possibilities as to the part sizes and shapes you can effectively process. The term “5-axis” refers to the number of directions in which the cutting tool can move. On a 5-axis machining center, the cutting tool moves across the X, Y and Z linear axes as well as rotates on the A and B axes to approach the workpiece from any direction. In other words, you can process five sides of a part in a single setup.",
