"Ultimate Tensile Strength - The ultimate tensile strength is a measure of the maximum stress a material can withstand without breaking or falling under load. It is indicated a material’s maximum ability to withstand stress before weakening. Yield Stress (0.2% & 0.5% PS) - The yield stress is often used to determine the maximum allowable load in a mechanical component, since it represents the upper limit to forces that can be applied without producing permanent deformation. Elongation % - Elongation is the measurable tendency of a material to stretch when under strain. It is a numerical measure of the ductility of the material — how easily it deforms under strain. It is measured according to very specific controlled conditions so that the values of elongation can be quantitatively compared between materials. Reduction of Area - Reduction of area is another measure of ductility and is obtained from the tensile test by measuring the original cross-sectional area of the specimen and relating it to the cross-sectional area after failure. Bend Strength Test - The bending strength of a material is defined as its ability to resist deformation under load. It is the maximum stress a material can withstand while being bent before it breaks.Flattening Test - Flattening tests are commonly made on specimens cut from tubular products and is conducted by subjecting rings from the tube or pipe to a prescribed degree of flattening between two parallel platens. A Pass/Fail test, tube flattening is used to determine whether or not the tube will fracture upon flattening. Flaring Test - A tapered mandrel is inserted into the sample to expand by an angle the mouth of the flare in which the adjacent length of the angle shall follow specification. The expansion of the inside and outside diameter is also dependent on standard specifications. After the test, the samples must not have any visible cracks. Compression Test - Compression testing is a widely used mechanical test that provides valuable insights into the behaviour of materials when subjected to compressive loads. A sample of the material is placed between two plates or jaws of a testing machine. A compressive force is applied to the sample until it reaches a specific deformation or until it fractures Shear Test - A shear test is designed to apply stress to a test sample so that it experiences a sliding failure along a plane that is parallel to the forces applied. Shear tests differ from tension and compression tests in that the forces applied are parallel to the two contact surface, whereas, in tension and compression they are perpendicular to the contact surfaces."
